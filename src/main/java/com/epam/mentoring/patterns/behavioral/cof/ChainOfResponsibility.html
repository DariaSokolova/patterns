	<h1>Chain of Responsibility</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and 
	pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.<br>
	Should be used when more than one object may handle a request, and the handler isn't known a priori. The handler should be ascertained automatically;
	there is a need to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly; 
	the set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically.
