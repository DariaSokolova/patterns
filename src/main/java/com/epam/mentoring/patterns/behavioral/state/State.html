	<h1>State</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.<br>
	Should be used when an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at run-time depending on that state;
	operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object's state. 

	<h4>Using in java API: </h4>

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Localizes state-specific behavior and partitions behavior for different states.</li>
	<li>Makes state transitions explicit.</li>
	<li>State objects can be shared.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Even for simple state machines a large number of classes need to be implemented.</li>
	<li>The state interface as defined in the pattern is expensive to maintain when a new event is introduced.</li>
	</ul>
