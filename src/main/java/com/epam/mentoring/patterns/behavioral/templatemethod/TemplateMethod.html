	<h1>Template Method</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine 
	certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm'sstructure.<br>
	Should be used to implement the invariant parts of an algorithm once and leave it up to subclasses to implement the behavior that can vary;
	when common behavior among subclasses should be factored and localized in a common class to avoid code duplication;
	to control subclasses extensions. You can define a template method that calls "hook" operations (see Consequences) at specific points,
	thereby permitting extensions only at those points.
