	<h1>Visitor</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing 
	the classes of the elements on which it operates.<br>
	Should be used when an object structure contains many classes of objects with differing interfaces, and there is a need 
	to perform operations on these objects that depend on their concrete classes;
	many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on objects in an object structure, and you want to avoid "polluting" 
	their classes with these operations;
	the classes defining the object structure rarely change, but you often want to define new operations over the structure.

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Makes adding new operations easy.</li>
	<li>Gathers related operations and separates unrelated ones.</li>
	<li>Accumulating state.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Adding new ConcreteElement classes is hard.</li>
	<li>Difficulties in visiting across class hierarchies.</li>
	<li>Breaking encapsulation.</li>
	</ul>
