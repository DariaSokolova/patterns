	<h1>Template Method</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and 
	support undoable operations.<br>
	Should be used to parameterize objects by an action to perform; specify, queue, and execute requests at different times; support undo;
	support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system crash; structure a system around high-level operations built 
	on primitives operations.

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.</li>
	<li>Commands are first-class objects. They can be manipulated and extended like any other object.</li>
	<li>Commands can be assembled into a composite command.</li>
	<li>It's easy to add new Commands, because there is no need to change existing classes.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Forcing a lot of Command classes that can make a design look cluttered.</li>
	</ul>
