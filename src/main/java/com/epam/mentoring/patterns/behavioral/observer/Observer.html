	<h1>Observer</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.<br>
	Should be used when an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other;
	a change to one object requires changing others, and it's unknown how many objects need to be changed;
	an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are.
