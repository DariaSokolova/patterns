	<h1>Composite</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.<br>
	Should be used there is a need to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects; 
	clients should be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.

	<h4>Using in java API: </h4>

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Primitive objects can be composed into more complex objects, which in turn can be composed, and so on recursively. Wherever client code expects
		a primitive object, it can also take a composite object.</li>
		<li>Makes the client simple.</li>
		<li>Makes it easier to add new kinds of components.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Can make a design overly general.</li>
	</ul>
