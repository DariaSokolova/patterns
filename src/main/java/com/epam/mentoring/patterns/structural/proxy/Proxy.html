	Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.<br>
	Should be used when there is a need to have a a local representative for an object in a different address space;
	to create expensive objects on demand; to control access to the original object; 
	to have a replacement for a bare reference that performs additional actions when an object is accessed.
