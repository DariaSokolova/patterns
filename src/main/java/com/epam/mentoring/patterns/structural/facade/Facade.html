	<h1>Facade</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.<br>
	Should be used when there is a need to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem; 
	there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction;
	there is a need to layer your subsystems. 

	<h4>Using in java API: </h4>
	Probably: <br>
	javax.servlet.http.HttpSession<br>
	javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest
	

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Shields clients from subsystem components, thereby reducing the number of objects that clients deal with and making the subsystem easier to use.</li>
		<li>Promotes weak coupling between the subsystem and its clients.</li>
		<li>Doesn't prevent applications from using subsystem classes if they need to.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Subsystem methods are connected to the Facade layer. If the structure of the subsystem changes then it will require subsequent change to the Fa√ßade layer 
		and client methods.</li>
	</ul>
