	<h1>Adapter</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of 
	incompatible interfaces. <br>
	Should be used when there is a need to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one needed; 
	to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes;
	there is a need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object
	adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li>Helps achieve reusability and flexibility.</li>
		<li>Can interconnects two incompatible interfaces.</li>
		<li>Allows to use new APIs (with different interfaces) and to not break existing implementations.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Aren't transparent to all clients (can be fixed by using two-way adapters).</li>
		<li>All requests are forwarded.</li>
		<li>Some number of adaptations may be needed on an adapter chain to reach the type which is required.</li>
	</ul>
