	<h1>Bridge</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.<br>
	Should be used where there is a need to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation; both the abstractions and their 
	implementations should be extensible by subclassing; changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on clients; 
	to share an implementation among multiple objects, and this fact should be hidden from the client.

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Decoupling interface and implementation.</li>
		<li>Improves extensibility.</li>
		<li>Hiding implementation details from clients.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Increases complexity.</li>
		<li>Double indirection - impact on performance.</li>
