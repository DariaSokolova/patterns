	<h1>Abstract Factory</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.<br>
	Should be used when a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented;
	a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products;
	a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint;
	there is a need to provide a class library of products and to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Isolates concrete classes and helps control the classes of objects that an application creates. 
	A factory encapsulates the responsibility and the process of creating product objects, it isolates clients from implementation classes. 
	Clients manipulate instances through their abstract interfaces. Product class names are isolated in the implementation of the concrete factory; 
	they do not appear in client code.</li>
	<li>Makes exchanging product families easy. The class of a concrete factory appears only once in an application â€” where it's instantiated. 
	This makes it easy to change the concrete factory an application uses. It can use different product configurations simply by changing the concrete factory. 
	Because an abstract factory creates a complete family of products, the whole product family changes at once.</li>
	<li>Promotes consistency among products. When product objects in a family are designed to work together, it's important that an application use
	objects from only one family at a time. AbstractFactory makes this easy to enforce.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Supporting new kinds of products is difficult. It requires extending the factory interface, which involves changing the AbstractFactory class and 
	all of its subclasses</li>
	</ul>
