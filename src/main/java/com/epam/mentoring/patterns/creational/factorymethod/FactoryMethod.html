	<h1>Factory Method</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.<br>
	Should be used when a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create; 
	a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates;
	classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and there is a need to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>The code only deals with the product interfaces; therefore, it can work with any user-defined concrete product classes.</li>
	<li>Provides hooks for subclasses. Creating objects inside a class with a factory method is always more flexible than creating an object directly.</li>
	<li>Connects parallel class hierarchies.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Might have to create subclass of product creator for an each new type of product.</li>
	</ul>
