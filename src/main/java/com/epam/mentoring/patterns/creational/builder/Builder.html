	<h1>Builder</h1>
	<h2>Description:</h2>
	Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.<br>
	Should be used when the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled;
	the construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed.

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Lets vary a product's internal representation. The Builder object provides the director with an abstract interface for constructing the product. 
	The interface lets the builder hide the representation and internal structure of the product. </li>
	<li>Hides how the product gets assembled. Because the product is constructed through an abstract interface, all you have to do to change 
	the product's internal representation is define a new kind of builder.</li>
	<li>Isolates code for construction and representation. The Builder pattern improves modularity by encapsulating the way a complex object is
	constructed and represented. Clients needn't know anything about the classes that define the product's internal structure; such classes don't appear 
	in Builder's interface.</li>
	<li>Gives a finer control over the construction process. The Builder pattern constructs the product step by step under the director's control. 
	Only when the product is finished does the director retrieve it from the builder. Hence the Builder interface reflects the process of constructing the 
	product more than other creational patterns.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Requires creating a separate ConcreteBuilder for each different type of Product.</li>
	</ul>
